For each serial in the set, look up the item, prune invalid/out-of-range entries, and CheckAndLoot items within loot range (Distance \u003c 3).\n\nPITFALL: Iterating a HashSet while modifying it throws. Collect serials to remove in a temporary list, then remove after iteration. OR use a snapshot/copy approach.\nPITFALL: item.Distance is relative to player current position and recalculates automatically -- no manual recalculation needed.\nPITFALL: OnPositionChanged fires ~4 times/second while running. The iteration must be cheap. Iterating 50-100 entries with dictionary lookups is ~0.01ms.\nPITFALL: The HashSet approach avoids the _world.Items.Values collection-modified-during-enumeration risk entirely since we iterate our own set.\n\nSteps:\n- Replace the foreach (Item item in _world.Items.Values) block in OnPositionChanged\n- New logic: iterate _nearbyGroundItems, look up each serial via _world.Items.Get()\n- If item is null (destroyed), not on ground, or locked -\u003e mark for removal\n- If item.Distance \u003e= SCAVENGER_TRACKING_RADIUS -\u003e mark for removal (left tracking area)\n- If item.Distance \u003c 3 (within loot range) -\u003e CheckAndLoot(item)\n- After iteration, remove all marked serials from the set\n- If _nearbyGroundItems is empty and scavenger is enabled, call BootstrapNearbyGroundItems()\n\n## Test Steps\n1.
